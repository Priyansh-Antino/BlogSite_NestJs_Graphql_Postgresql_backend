Yes, to effectively use the `User` model (or entity) with TypeORM in a NestJS application, you typically need to follow these steps. Let's break down why each part is necessary and how it all fits together.

### 1. **TypeORM Configuration in `TypeOrmModule.forRoot()`**
   ```typescript
   TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
     type: 'postgres',
     host: 'localhost',
     port: 5432,
     username: 'postgres',
     password: '12345678',
     database: 'blog_site',
     entities: [User], // Include your entities here
     synchronize: true, // Automatically syncs the database schema
   }),
   ```
   - **Purpose**: This sets up the global TypeORM configuration for your NestJS application, telling it how to connect to the PostgreSQL database and which entities (models) to use.
   - **Entities**: You include all the entities (like `User`) that TypeORM should be aware of in this configuration. These entities correspond to database tables.
   - **Synchronize**: If `true`, TypeORM will automatically synchronize the database schema with your entity definitions. This is useful during development but typically not recommended for production.

### 2. **UsersModule Definition**
   ```typescript
   @Module({
     imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])],
     providers: [UsersResolver, UsersService],
   })
   export class UsersModule {}
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `UsersModule` is a feature module in NestJS that groups related components (like services, resolvers, and other providers) together.
   - **`TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User])`**: This imports the `User` entity's repository into the `UsersModule`. By doing this, you make the repository available for dependency injection within this module. This is necessary because it allows you to interact with the `User` table in the database.

### 3. **UsersService**
   ```typescript
   @Injectable()
   export class UsersService {
     constructor(
       @InjectRepository(User) private usersRepository: Repository<User>,
     ) {}
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose**: The `UsersService` class contains the business logic for the `User` entity, such as creating, retrieving, updating, or deleting users.
   - **`@InjectRepository(User)`**: This decorator injects the `User` entity's repository into the service, allowing you to perform database operations related to the `User` entity.

### 4. **Putting It All Together**
   - **Global Configuration (`TypeOrmModule.forRoot`)**: Sets up the database connection and entities globally.
   - **Feature Module (`UsersModule`)**: Organizes the `User` entity's related services and resolvers, and makes the `User` repository available for injection.
   - **Service (`UsersService`)**: Implements the business logic using the injected `User` repository.

### Summary
- **Global Database Configuration**: You configure the connection to the database and register the entities globally using `TypeOrmModule.forRoot()`.
- **Feature Module**: You register the entity's repository in the module where you'll use it, using `TypeOrmModule.forFeature()`.
- **Service**: The service uses the injected repository to perform database operations.

This setup ensures that your application is modular, organized, and adheres to the dependency injection principles that make NestJS a powerful framework.
